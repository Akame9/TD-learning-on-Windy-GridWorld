Topic Name: Implementation of TD-Learning Methods in Windy Gridworld Environment

Designed and developed an artificial intelligence agent using various Temporal Difference (TD) learning algorithms to navigate a Windy Gridworld, a standard environment for reinforcement learning tasks.
Applied and compared the performance of multiple reinforcement learning methods such as On-policy Monte-Carlo, SARSA, Expected SARSA, n-step SARSA, and Q-learning, optimizing each algorithmâ€™s hyperparameters to achieve efficient learning rates.
Enhanced the basic Windy Gridworld task by integrating King's moves and stochastic wind effects, leading to a more complex decision-making scenario and demonstrating the robustness of TD methods under dynamic and uncertain conditions.
